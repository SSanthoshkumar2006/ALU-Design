This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL.
The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logical operations based on a 3-bit control signal (opcode).
The design is purely combinational and verified using a Verilog testbench with waveform analysis.

This mini project is created as part of learning Digital Design and VLSI fundamentals.
